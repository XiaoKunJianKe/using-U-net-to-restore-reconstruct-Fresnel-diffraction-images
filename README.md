# using U-net to reconstruct Fresnel diffraction images



   ## Learning to construct images by Fresnel diffraction

#### Introduction
    In optics, the Fresnel diffraction equation for near-field diffraction approximation of the Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction that can be applied to the propagation of waves in the near field. It is used to calculate the diffraction pattern created by waves passing through an aperture or around an object, when viewed from relatively close to the object.
In order to demonstrate Fresnel diffraction theory for images (optical wave), I did its simulation and modeling by MATLAB. As shown in figure 1 below, we found that the image [Fig.1 (a)] by Fresnel diffraction has changed [Fig.1 (b)] in content presenting a girl wearing a hat , which one cannot recognize its information. The research value of the theory such as Fresnel diffraction is significant because its influence mechanism for images is similar foggy weather. Therefore, I first study the Fresnel diffraction theory for images. And the all Fresnel diffraction images are from MATLAB simulation in the rest of the article.
